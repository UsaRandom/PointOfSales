To enable Database Interaction, execute the provided 'PosData.sql' script in a MS SQLServer Database.
It will install a schema and user/pass for the POS application to use.

After installing the Schema use the following Credentials: 

Database Name: PosData
Username: PosUser
Password: pospass

If you do not have MS SQLServer installed, you can use the XML instead. (XSD Validation is not required but recommeneded)
